![TrailGage logo](https://github.com/DIT112-V20/group-11/blob/TrailGage/assets/TrailGageLogo.png)
### <a id="1.1"></a>What we made.
Our product is a smart luggage carrier based on a **smart car platform** that provides users the ability to free their hands while traveling in scenarios such as airports and train stations. 

The product can be served for personal use or commercial use. For both uses, the TrailGage will move according to the commands given by the user through their device.The user can borrow the TrailGage from the luggage distributing hub and can be able to use it for their desired purpose.

### <a id="1.2"></a>Why will we make it?

We are doing this product in order to assist persons with the luggage transportation so they can avoid injuries by carrying out heavy weight and given them more freedom to handle other tasks like taking care of themselves, their families or others.

### What problem does it solve?
People from all walks of life travel each and every single day. As an evolving society, we decided to come up with this idea so as to benefit travelers who might have too much on their hands or simply just for the luxury of it. Moreover, this product will mostly be reliable for handicapped people.

Shortage of luggage trolleys is an issue in some airports, TrailGage is a modern and innovative way to deal with this hurdle.

## <a id="2"></a> How it works.

#### <a id="2.1"></a> Installation
The user will be able to install this by downloading the zip file from our GitHub repository.https://github.com/DIT112-V20/group-11
After downloading it, the user open their Android Studio app and upload the Trailgage app to their android phone. The user should now be able to access the car using the app.

#### <a id="2.2"></a> Usage
The user will have to type in the name of the car in the welcome page in order to connect to it. After this, the user should tap the "connect to a TrailGage" button which connects to the car and leads them into the next page. The next page consists of a joystick control feature which enables the user to control the car in whatever direction they desire.
There is also an information page which briefly explains the purpose of the app in case the user would like to know more about it.
