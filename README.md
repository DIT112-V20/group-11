TrailGage -- Smart luggage carrier

<img style="align: center" scr="../assets/TrailGageLogo.png">

### <a id="1.1"></a>What are we going to make?
Our product is a smart luggage carrier based on a **smart car platform** that provides users the ability to free their hands while traveling, in scenarios such as airports and train stations. 

The product can be served as personal use or commercial use. For personal use, the luggage carrier can automatically follow the user and avoid obstacles. The user can manually control it as well. For commercial use, for example in the airport, the luggage carrier starts from the luggage distributing hub and delivers the luggage to a predefined spot, once the luggage has been dropped off, it will autonomously return to the hub.

Also, if we have enough time we may implement more functionalities in the future.

### <a id="1.2"></a>Why will we make it?
### What problem does it solve?
People from all walks of life travel each and every single day. As an evolving society, we decided to come up with this idea so as to benefit travelers who might have too much on their hands or simply just for the luxury of it. Moreover, this product will mostly be reliable for handicapped people.

Shortage of luggage trolleys is an issue in some airports, TrailGage is a modern and innovative way to deal with this hurdle.
